# scio #

This is an R package for **Sparse Column-wise Inverse Operator**. 

The easiest way to install this package from GitHub is by the following R code:
	
	library(devtools)
	install_github("rluo/scio")

You can use `R CMD build scio` to create the source package.  This should be the same as the CRAN [scio](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scio/index.html)  package, because I will try to update the CRAN source as soon as I can.
